Assignment 5: Image Processing (Part 2)

The script commands supported are:
red-component
blue-component
green-component
luma-component
value-component
intensity-component
horizontal-flip
vertical-flip
brighten
darken
blur
sharpen
grayscale
sepia
save
load
file

All of the commands except save, load and file manipuate images and add new instances of Images to a
hashmap in the model

save and load don't maipulate images. Load adds an image to the hashmap in the model so the image
can be later called on. Save writes new image files and saves them in the res folder

for all the commands that manipualte images except for brighten and darken the format is:
Command SrcImage DestinationName

Command is the specific command the user wants, srcImage is the image that is having a new version
of it be manipulated, and DestinationName is what the newImage is called

Brighten and darken work similarly except their format is
Command Number SrcImage DestinationName
ex: red-component test1 testRed
the only thing that is different is the number, which represents how much to brighten or darken
an image by

The format for save is
save newImgName imgKey
ex: save test1.jpg test1

save is the command, newImgName is the name the image will have in the res folder and imgKey is what
the image is called in the hashmap

The format for load is
load src/res/imgName imgKey
ex: load src/res/test1.ppm t
load is the command, src/res/imgName is the filePath of the image and should be in the res folder
of the application, imgKey is what the image is called in the hashMap and how future commands will
call on the image.

The format for file is
file src/res/name
This takes is a text file in the res folder and executes all the commands in the file
ex: file src/res/script.txt

Lastly Quit or Q quits the application. This is not case sensitive
ex: q
